# Report Availability

Easily view which modules are accessible to which students.

## Idea

Moodleâ€™s conditional availability feature allows targeted access to course content. However, managing these conditions
can get very complex. This report provides a clear overview of which users have access to which modules or sections,
simplifying your workflow.

## Conditional availability conditions

Read the official Moodle documentation on conditional availability settings: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Conditional_activities_settings
